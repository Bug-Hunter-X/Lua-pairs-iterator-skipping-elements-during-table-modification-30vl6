This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Lua related to the `pairs` iterator and table modification during iteration. The `bug.lua` file contains a recursive function `foo` that iterates over a table using `pairs`. If the table is modified within the loop, `pairs` might skip elements, leading to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.lua` file provides a solution by iterating over a copy of the table, preventing modification during iteration.
